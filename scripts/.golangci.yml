    - staticcheck # Static analysis checks
    - unused # Check for unused code

    # Additional recommended linters
    - bodyclose # Check HTTP response body is closed
    - dogsled # Check for too many blank identifiers
    - dupl # Code duplication detection
    - errorlint # Find issues with error wrapping
    - copyloopvar # Check for loop variable capture issues
    - goconst # Find repeated strings that could be constants
    - gocritic # Opinionated Go linter
    - gocyclo # Check cyclomatic complexity
    - gofmt # Check code is formatted
    - goimports # Check imports are organized
    - gosec # Security checks
    - misspell # Find commonly misspelled English words
    - nakedret # Check for naked returns in long functions
    - nilerr # Check for returning nil after checking err
    - nolintlint # Check nolint directives
    - revive # Fast, configurable linter (replaces golint)
    - unconvert # Remove unnecessary type conversions
    - whitespace # Check for unnecessary whitespace

    # Modernization linters
    - intrange # Use range over integers (Go 1.22+)
    - perfsprint # Modern string formatting (fmt.Sprintf -> strconv)
    - tenv # Use t.Setenv in tests (Go 1.17+)
    - tparallel # Correct t.Parallel() usage
    - usestdlibvars # Use stdlib constants (http.MethodGet vs "GET")
  # Note: typecheck is implicitly disabled (not in enable list)
  # golangci-lint v1.62.2 was built with Go 1.23 and cannot check Go 1.25 modules
  # Type checking is still performed by go vet and go test with Go 1.25
