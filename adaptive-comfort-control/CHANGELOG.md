## [4.7.1] - 2025-10-31
### Fixed
- Variable order dependency for occupancy-aware setback (`occ_now` / `setback_apply_c`) that could cause undefined or stale values at runtime.
- Hardened setpoint output path to use climate-unit conversion and thermostat min/max clamping to prevent out-of-range errors.

### Notes
- No behavior change to the adaptive model itself; fix ensures reliable evaluation order and safer setpoint writes across thermostats.

## [4.7.0] - 2025-10-31
### Added
- Optional barometric pressure sensor input with automatic unit conversion (kPa, hPa/mbar, Pa, inHg, mmHg).
- Optional site elevation input and automatic fallback to state-based LUT when regional presets are enabled.
- Dynamic pressure calculation now used for humidity ratio and psychrometric equations.
- Debug summary now includes resolved pressure (kPa) for verification.

### Improved
- Psychrometric accuracy at altitude (especially in CO/UT/WY) for dewpoint, AH, and enthalpy-based ventilation guards.
- Blueprint now self-corrects pressure assumptions for high-elevation sites.

### Fixed
- Removed previous hard-coded sea-level pressure (101.325 kPa) for improved realism and consistency.
