        Adaptive comfort control + HVAC pause with unit awareness (°C/°F), seasonal bias,
        built-in psychrometrics (dew point, absolute humidity, enthalpy), optional RMOT,
        and CO₂-driven ventilation preference. Includes per-field help text and regional
        presets (seasonal bias + ventilation/psychrometrics/CO₂) by U.S. state or region.
