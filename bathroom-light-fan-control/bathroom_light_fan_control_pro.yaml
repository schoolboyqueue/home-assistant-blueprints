  name: Bathroom Light & Fan Control (Pro)
  description: >-
    Smart bathroom controller for lights and exhaust fan.
    Lights: Turns on from motion or door activity (Wasp-in-a-Box), respects presence and optional lux threshold, supports Night Mode (dim and color temperature), and shuts off after vacancy with a grace period. Includes a manual-off override window to prevent auto-on.
    Fan: Controls by humidity delta (bathroom minus home) with hysteresis to avoid chatter. Supports minimum/maximum runtime, optional early rate-of-rise boost, rate-of-fall hold, and a post-shower purge latch.
    Compatible with a single light entity or an Area, and with either fan.* or switch.* for the fan device.
  # NOTE: Manual-off override arms only when the configured `light_target` turns off. If you use `light_area`, ensure `light_target` reflects wall switch/UI state changes.
